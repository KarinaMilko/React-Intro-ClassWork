# ⚛️ React Intro Classwork: JSX, Components, and Props

This repository is a comprehensive teaching project (**Classwork**) dedicated to mastering the fundamentals of **ReactJS**, focusing on **JSX**, functional components, styling, and data transfer via **Props**.

The project uses React, ReactDOM, and Babel, all connected directly through a CDN (Content Delivery Network) for a quick and easy start.

## 🎯 Key Learning Objectives

* **Setup**: Connecting React, ReactDOM, and Babel via CDN.
* **Functional Components**: Creating and rendering basic React components (e.g., `<Header>`, `<UserCard>`).
* **JSX and Expressions**: Embedding JavaScript expressions (`{variable}`) and implementing conditional rendering within the markup.
* **Styling**: Utilizing `className` for CSS classes and passing dynamic **inline styles** via JavaScript objects (`style={{...}}`).
* **Props**: Passing data from parent to child components (e.g., passing `newsItem` data to the `<News />` component).
* **Fragments**: Using the `<></>` syntax to return multiple elements without adding unnecessary `<div>` wrappers.

## 📁 Project Structure and Code Demonstration

* **`index.html`** (Setup): Links CSS, imports React/Babel via CDN, and defines the root element (`#root`).
* **`style.css`** (Styling): Contains basic CSS for the page layout (Header, Footer, UserCard).
* **`index.js`** (React Logic): Contains several **commented stages of development** that demonstrate the evolution of components, styling, data display, and working with Props.
